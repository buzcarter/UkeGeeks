{c:Verse 1}
I want to go [G]back to my little grass shack
In Kealakekua, [A7]Hawaii
I want to [D7]be with all the kanes and wahines
That I used to [G]know... so long ago
I can [B7]hear the old guitars a-playing[E7]
On the beach at Honaunau
I can [A7]hear the old Hawaiians saying
&quot;Komo [D7]mai no kaua i ka hale welakahau&quot;

{c:Verse 2}
It won't be [G]long till my ship will be sailing
Back to [A7]Kona
A [D7]grand old place
That's always fair to [B7]see... you're telling me
I'm [E7]just a little Hawaiian and a homesick island boy
I [A7]want to go back to my fish and poi

{start_of_chorus}
{c:Chorus}
I want to go [G]back to my little grass shack
In Kealakekua, [A7]Hawaii
Where the [D7]humu-humu nuku-nuku a pua'a
Go swimming [G]by
{end_of_chorus}

{c:Outro}
Where the [D7]humu-humu nuku-nuku a pua'a
Go swimming [G]by
